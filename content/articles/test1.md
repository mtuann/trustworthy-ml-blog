# Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and one or more independent variables $X$. It assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear, meaning the change in $y$ is proportional to the change in $X$.

The **simple linear regression** model can be written as:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon $$

Where:

- $y$ is the dependent variable (the target you want to predict),
- $x$ is the independent variable (the feature),
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept of the line,
- $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line (the coefficient),
- $\epsilon$ is the error term (representing noise or unaccounted factors).

## Key Metrics for Linear Regression

When evaluating the performance of a linear regression model, there are several important metrics to consider, such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**. Below is a table comparing the performance of different models:

| Model            | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | R-squared (R²) |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Model 1 (Baseline)| 3.12                     | 0.89           |
| Model 2 (Advanced)| 1.85                     | 0.93           |
| Model 3 (Optimized)| 0.95                    | 0.97           |

### Interpreting the Equation

The equation $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$ shows a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this equation:

- **$\beta_0$** represents the *intercept*, which is the predicted value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
- **$\beta_1$** is the *slope*, which indicates how much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$.

For example, if you are predicting the sales of a product based on advertising spend, the equation might look like:

$$ \text{Sales} = 500 + 30 \times \text{Advertising Spend} $$

This would suggest that for each unit increase in advertising spend, sales are expected to increase by 30 units.

## Conclusion

Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between variables and making predictions. By fitting a line to the data, you can gain insights into how your dependent variable behaves in relation to your independent variables. The key metrics, like MSE and $R^2$, help evaluate how well the model fits the data.
