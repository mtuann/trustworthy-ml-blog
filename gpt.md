Creating a blog using **Pelican** and deploying it to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions** is a great way to share content such as machine learning formulations, code, and tutorials. Below is a structured guide for setting up your project:

### Project Structure

Here's an outline of the folder structure for your **Pelican** project:

```
my-pelican-blog/
├── content/            # Directory for blog posts
│   ├── pages/          # Static pages (e.g., about, contact)
│   ├── articles/       # Your blog posts (Markdown files)
├── output/             # Generated static site files (Pelican will build here)
├── pelicanconf.py      # Pelican configuration file
├── publishconf.py      # Optional: Publishing configuration (for different environments)
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow file
├── Makefile            # Makefile for common commands
└── README.md           # Project README
```

### Step 1: Set Up Pelican

1. **Install Pelican**:

   First, you'll need to set up your Python environment and install Pelican. You can do this in a virtual environment or globally.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv pelican-env
   source pelican-env/bin/activate
   pip install pelican markdown
   ```

2. **Create Your Pelican Project**:

   Create the project directory and initialize Pelican.

   ```bash
   pelican-quickstart
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your project. It will ask for basic information like the site name, URL, and author.

3. **Directory Structure**:

   This will automatically create the project structure outlined above, including the `content` directory where you can add your blog posts, and the `output` directory where Pelican will generate the static site.

4. **Configure Pelican (`pelicanconf.py`)**:

   Edit the `pelicanconf.py` file to configure settings like the theme, language, and plugins. You can also configure MathJax for rendering LaTeX:

   ```python
   # pelicanconf.py

   THEME = "notmyidea"  # You can choose your theme or use "notmyidea" theme
   PLUGIN_PATHS = ['plugins']
   PLUGINS = ['render_math']

   # MathJax (optional, for LaTeX rendering)
   MATHJAX_URL = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js'
   ```

5. **Add Content**:

   Add blog posts in the `content/articles/` directory in **Markdown** format. For example:

   ```bash
   content/
   ├── articles/
   │   ├── first-post.md
   │   └── another-post.md
   ```

   You can write these posts in Markdown, using LaTeX for equations if needed:

   ```markdown
   # My First Post

   This is a sample post.

   $$ f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 $$

   ```
   
### Step 2: Local Development (Previewing the Site)

Before deploying, you can preview the site locally:

1. **Generate the Static Site**:

   Run Pelican to generate your static files:

   ```bash
   pelican content
   ```

2. **Preview the Site**:

   You can preview the site using the built-in development server:

   ```bash
   pelican --listen
   ```

   This will start a local server (usually on `http://localhost:8000`), where you can view your blog.

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions

To automatically deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you can use **GitHub Actions**. This involves creating a workflow file that builds the Pelican site and pushes it to your GitHub Pages branch (`gh-pages`).

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:

   If you haven't already, create a new GitHub repository for your blog.

2. **GitHub Action Configuration**:

   Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository to define the deployment process:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Pelican Blog to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Trigger on pushes to the main branch

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         # Step 1: Checkout the code
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         # Step 2: Set up Python
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.x'

         # Step 3: Install dependencies
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install pelican markdown

         # Step 4: Build the site
         - name: Build the Pelican site
           run: |
             pelican content
             
         # Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           with:
             publish_dir: ./output  # Directory to deploy
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_branch: gh-pages  # Branch where your site will be deployed
   ```

3. **Create a `gh-pages` Branch** (if it doesn't exist):

   GitHub Pages uses the `gh-pages` branch to serve the website. If the branch doesn’t exist, create it:

   ```bash
   git checkout --orphan gh-pages
   git rm -rf .
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial gh-pages commit"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:

   Push all your files (including `.github`, `pelicanconf.py`, `content/`, etc.) to the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Pelican setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

   The GitHub Action will trigger, build your site, and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch.

---

### Step 4: Set Up GitHub Pages

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   Go to your GitHub repository's settings:
   - In the **"Pages"** section, choose the **`gh-pages`** branch as the source.
   - After the action runs successfully, your blog will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name`.

---

### Step 5: Optional Customizations

1. **Themes**:
   Pelican has several themes available. You can find them [here](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes). To change the theme, simply modify the `THEME` variable in `pelicanconf.py`:

   ```python
   THEME = "path/to/your/theme"
   ```

2. **Plugins**:
   Pelican supports various plugins. You might want to use the `pelican-plugins` repo for more advanced functionality, like pagination, related posts, or custom markdown extensions.

### Final Project Structure

After setting up everything, your project structure should look like this:

```
my-pelican-blog/
├── content/
│   ├── articles/
│   │   ├── first-post.md
│   │   └── another-post.md
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── about.md
├── output/              # Generated static site (automatically created)
├── pelicanconf.py       # Pelican configuration file
├── publishconf.py       # Optional: Publishing configuration
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml   # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
├── Makefile             # Makefile for common commands
├── README.md            # Project README
└── .gitignore           # Ignore output and virtualenv files
```

---

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ll have a **Pelican-based blog** that renders **machine learning content** (including equations and code) and deploys automatically to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**. This setup makes it easy to manage content, and the automation provided by GitHub Actions allows for seamless updates to your blog whenever you push changes to the main branch.

Good luck with your blog, and feel free to ask if you need further assistance!
